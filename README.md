# Advanced Lane Finding

This is a project for the Udacity Self Driving Car Nanodegree. This project was cloned down from their repository and completed for a homework assignment.

## Files

1. `camera-calibrate.py` - Perform camera calibration and save the results to a pickle file to be used later
2. `camera-calibration.p` - The aforementioned output of the camera calibration
3. `pipeline.py` - Contains a function `functionName` that will return the image with a highlighted lane, calculated left lane, right lane, and average road curvatures.
4. `video.py` - Will take a video file and then output the same video, with overlayed lane highlighting and average curvature overlayed
5. `generate_example_images.py` - will run the pipeline process and save the overlayed images from the test_images folder
6. `generate_undistorted_images.py` - will run just the undistort command on all images, saving them to undistorted_images folder
7. `WRITEUP.md` - The writeup file for this project
8. `examples` folder - This folder will contain screen shots of each stage of the program, generated by calling pipeline() function with the parameter debug=True
